## Background and Problem
Rice students would often feel out of the loop on what Rice Sporting events were happening during the day and during the week as well as the results of those games. 
The current option to look at games was to go to the rice sports website but it could be quite distracting. The games were on top but there were so many other articles and ads that took away from just simply and easily looking at the game scores. On top of that, Rice Students are incredibly busy. So we wanted to be able to access the game results and see future games quickly. 

## Solution
A chrome extension that displays information for current, recent, and future rice sporting events with one click. No friction :)

I documented a lot of the process and got some feedback from users (students) in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pelufafowora/status/1350644654769844224)

## Learnings along the way
- In order to create designs for the sports games, I learned some figma
- JS, CSS, HTML -> This project was my first web dev experience.
