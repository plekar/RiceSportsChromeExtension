# RiceSportsChromeExtension
Chrome extension for Rice Sports

## Note
Data source deprecated so the extension is no longer functional. 

## Background and Problem
Rice students would often feel out of the loop on what Rice Sporting events were happening during the day and during the week as well as the results of those games. 
The current option to look at games was to go to the rice sports website but it could be quite distracting. The games were on top but there were so many other articles and ads that took away from just simply and easily looking at the game scores. On top of that, Rice Students are incredibly busy. So we wanted to be able to access the game results and see future games quickly. 

## Solution
A chrome extension that displays information for current, recent, and future rice sporting events with one click. No friction :)

If you want to see a deeper look into the process of building this, hereâ€™s a twitter post documenting it. I also used twitter to get some feedback from rice students during dev.
