Chrome extension for Rice Sports

## Background and Problem
I felt like I was out of the loop on what Rice Sporting events were happening during the day and during the week as well as the results of those games. 
The current option to look at games was to go to the rice sports website but it could be quite distracting. The games were on top but there were so many other articles and ads that took away from just simply and easily looking at the game scores.
I wanted to be able to access the game results and see future games quickly.
